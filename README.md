# Livepeer Bounties

Welcome to the Livepeer Software Bounties program! [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/) is a decentralized community building the world's open video infrastructure. We're excited to invite you to contribute and earn rewards for your efforts. Visit the [issues tab](https://github.com/livepeer/bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee) to find community-requested tasks with rewards for completion. Several entities within the Livepeer ecosystem offer bounties, including:

- The [AI SPE](https://explorer.livepeer.org/treasury/42084921863832634370966409987770520882792921083596034115019946998721416745190): A special purpose entity focused on putting AI jobs on the Livepeer network. Their bounties are labelled [AI](https://github.com/livepeer/bounties/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3AAI) and funded by the Livepeer [treasury](https://dune.com/dob/livepeer-treasury).

Only members of these entities can create issues in the issues tab. If you have ideas for bounties, questions about the program, or need assistance, please use the [Discussions Board](https://github.com/livepeer/bounties/discussions) or join the [#ðŸ›‹â”‚developer-lounge](https://discord.com/channels/423160867534929930/1051963444598943784) channel on our Discord server.
